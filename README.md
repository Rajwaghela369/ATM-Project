# ATM-Project
Automated Teller Machine Program.

## OVERVIEW
This repository contains the source code and resources for an ATM (Automated Teller Machine) simulation project. The project aims to replicate basic functionalities of an ATM system, allowing users to perform various banking operations such as checking balance, depositing money, withdrawing cash, changing PIN, and viewing transaction statements.
## GIT
I consistently utilized Git to commit and push my progress for the ATM project to GitHub, ensuring regular updates to the repository. My workflow primarily involved working in Visual Studio Code, where I developed and tested the code. I maintained a consistent cadence of uploading code to GitHub through Visual Studio Code, reflecting my contributions and project activity on the GitHub [contribution chart](https://github.com/Rajwaghela369).

## METRICS
  
I employed SonarQube to conduct automated analyses of the ATM project's source code, utilizing a comprehensive set of criteria to evaluate code quality. SonarQube, an open-source tool, facilitates continuous code quality inspection by employing static code analysis to identify bugs, code smells, and other key metrics.

The following metrics offer a comprehensive assessment of the code by SonarCloud:

## Clean Code Developement 

I have included a main [sheet](https://github.com/Rajwaghela369/ATM-Project/blob/main/Cheat%20Sheet/sheet.txt) that served as a guide throughout the development of this application.  Here are some key points:

  1. The code is split into separate modules, each handling specific tasks. This approach enhances understanding and maintainability by isolating functionality into cohesive units.

  2. Meaningful names are used for variables and functions, enhancing code readability and comprehension. For example, variables like ([eg](https://github.com/Rajwaghela369/ATM-Project/blob/670e259c3710487df09b4f0725d05ac47c1904b8/ATM_Project/Authentication.py#L34)) and functions like ([eg](https://github.com/Rajwaghela369/ATM-Project/blob/670e259c3710487df09b4f0725d05ac47c1904b8/ATM_Project/Account.py#L39)) convey their purpose clearly.

  3.  Standardized naming conventions are followed consistently across the codebase, ensuring clarity and uniformity. For instance, boolean flags like ["valid"](https://github.com/Rajwaghela369/ATM-Project/blob/670e259c3710487df09b4f0725d05ac47c1904b8/ATM_Project/Database.py#L43) are used for user verification, adhering to established conventions.

  4. Informative comments like ([eg](https://github.com/Rajwaghela369/ATM-Project/blob/670e259c3710487df09b4f0725d05ac47c1904b8/ATM_Project/Authentication.py#L32C12-L32C34)) are provided throughout the codebase to clarify complex logic or functionalities. These comments serve as valuable documentation, aiding others in understanding the code better and facilitating collaboration.

## BUILD AND CI/CD
## UNIT TESTS
## IDE Visual Studio Code 

I have utilized Visual Studio Code (VS Code) as the Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for this project on my Mac.
Some useful shortcuts in VS Code that I found particularly helpful:

Cmd + Shift + B: Build project

F5: Run or debug the application

Cmd + /: Comment/uncomment lines of code

Cmd + D: Select next occurrence of the current word

Cmd + F: Search within the file

These shortcuts and features contribute to a smoother development experience in Visual Studio Code for the ATM project on macOS.


Advantages of using Visual Studio Code for development on macOS:

  1. Cross-platform compatibility for seamless development across different operating systems.
  2. Extensive plugin ecosystem for customizable functionality and enhanced productivity.
  3. Active community support for learning, collaboration, and access to helpful resources.
